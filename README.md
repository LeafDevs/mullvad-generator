# mullvad-generator
A script that generates mullvad codes and checks them.

All valid and working codes will be sent into codes.txt

you can change the delay of checking them to avoid rate limit on checking. 

i made this script in the middle of a "Last to leave vc" challenge with a ton of nazis and racists in it.

please no script kiddies steal my code :) Thank you.
